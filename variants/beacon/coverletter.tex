Dear Beacon Team:

Over the last three years working at Mesmer, I've been directly responsible for several mission-critical projects.

My work creating Mesmer's internal reporting system is most relevant to what I would work on at Beacon---it used Python and an SQL database to incrementally sync and evaluate thousands of data points into a few easily-understood Confluence pages. I was also responsible for documenting the reporting system's functionality, and configuring nightly runs in GitHub Actions.

I'm passionate about writing very high-quality code, and I think I would be a really good fit at Beacon. I look forward to learning more about the Front Office Suite, and I'm excited to move forward with the interview process!

Sincerely,
