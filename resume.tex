\work
{2019-2021}
{Mesmer Eyes, Inc}
{Remote}
{Developer (2019-2021), Intern (2019)}
{
	Worked to automate mobile app user experience and accessibility testing. Spearheaded several projects:

	\vbeat
	\textbf{Mesmer Gherkin}:
	a compiler for English-language descriptions of app tests
	(\textit{Rust})

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Built a compiler for a test description language similar to English, empowering customers to precisely define app tests, across Android and iOS, without technical knowledge
	\item Unified many of Mesmer's different internal representations of test logic into one common syntax tree
	\item Collaborated with the Customer Success Team, writing Gherkin code to rapidly solve client problems
	\item Employed coverage-guided fuzzing and extensive snapshot testing to find new bugs and stop regressions
	\end{itemize}

    \vbeat
	\textbf{The Mesmer Sidecar}:
	dynamic test instrumentation for Android apps
	(\textit{Rust, Android/Java})

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Built system to locally audit Android apps for accessibility issues, attaching to target apps at runtime and evaluating a proprietary ruleset against data extracted from Android APIs and in-house heuristics
	\item Built system to attach to a running Android app, extract accessibility data, and run in-house heuristics
	\item Created WCAG 2.0 rules engine to find accessibility issues and explain what's needed to fix them
	\item Designed marketing materials, website, and pitch video for release on Product Hunt (\#3 App of the Day)
	\end{itemize}

    \vbeat
	\textbf{The Mesmer CLI}: 
	stable command-line interface to Mesmer tools
	(\textit{Rust})

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Created a tool to expose most Mesmer platform functionality to developers working from the command line.
	\item Handled frequent changes in unstable internal APIs to maintain a stable ``evergreen'' public scripting interface
	\item Implemented CI/CD and a comprehensive test suite, auto-importing user error reports into failing tests, and deploying fixes across Mac, Windows, and Linux auto-updaters in 20min
	\item Provided front-line support, dealing directly with five Fortune 500 clients and many other smaller businesses
	\end{itemize}
}

\work
{2019}
{Wolfram Research}
{Waltham, Massachusetts}
{Student, Wolfram Summer Camp}
{
	Researched both traditional and machine learning approaches to algorithmically determine the physical scale of satellite images. Final model achieved $r^2 = 0.73$ using feature extraction and a small dense neural net.
}


\work
{2017-2018}
{Transparensee Systems}
{New York, NY}
{Intern, Developer}
{
	Created a client-facing customization tool for web embeds. This project was deployed to more than 60 local newspapers across the US, allowing non-technical users to integrate real estate platform \www{enclosure.io} and agricultural classifieds site \www{agrisearch.com} with their own properties.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Designed and built full-stack web applications (React/Redux frontend, Express.js backend)
	\item Created an automated CI/CD pipeline to build, test, and deploy the application to Kubernetes
	\end{itemize}
}

\project
{Motor Controller (2021)}
{FPGA-based closed-loop proportional servo controller. Used feedback from a quadrature encoder to position an output shaft with sub-degree precision.}
{Designed in VHDL, coursework for ECE 2031, Digital Design Lab.}

\project
{Boolean (2020)}
{Symbolic computer algebra system for rule-based simplification of Boolean expressions. Contains a rudimentary SAT solver.}
{Written in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly, runs in-browser at \www{boolean.w01.dev}.}

\project
{Cookie (2019)}
{Dynamic cookbook. Based on the user's cooking preferences, construct a set of recipes as dependency graphs, simplify them by merging similar steps, and sequence them in parallel as the user cooks the meal.}
{Android, iOS app implement with React Native and TypeScript. Released to Google Play: \www{bit.ly/2muVZIY}.}
