\work
{2019-2021}
{Mesmer Eyes, Inc}
{Remote}
{Developer (2019-2021), Intern (2019)}
{
	Worked to automate mobile app user experience and accessibility testing. Spearheaded several projects:

	\vbeat
	\textbf{Mesmer Gherkin}:
	a compiler for English-language descriptions of app tests
	(\textit{Rust})

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Built a compiler for a test description language similar to English, empowering customers to precisely define app tests, across Android and iOS, without technical knowledge
	\item Unified many of Mesmer's different internal representations of test logic into one common syntax tree
	\item Collaborated with the Customer Success Team, writing Gherkin code to rapidly solve client problems
	\item Employed coverage-guided fuzzing and extensive snapshot testing to find new bugs and stop regressions
	\end{itemize}

	\vbeat
	\textbf{Automated Reporting}: automate creation of product-performance scorecards in Confluence
	(\textit{Python, SQL})

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Built an incremental sync system to gather historical performance data from dozens of customer accounts into one common SQL database
	\item Created a reporting engine in Python to synthesize and format that data, publishing reports to Confluence
	\item Automated a tedious manual task, reducing human errors and increasing accuracy
	\end{itemize}

    \vbeat
	\textbf{The Mesmer Sidecar}:
	instant accessibility audits for Android apps
	(\textit{Rust, Android/Java})

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Built system to locally audit Android apps for accessibility issues, attaching to target apps at runtime and evaluating a proprietary ruleset against data extracted from Android APIs and in-house heuristics
	\item Built system to attach to a running Android app, extract accessibility data, and run in-house heuristics
	\item Created WCAG 2.0 rules engine to find accessibility issues and explain what's needed to fix them
	\item Designed marketing materials, website, and pitch video for release on Product Hunt (\#3 App of the Day)
	\end{itemize}

    \vbeat
	\textbf{The Mesmer CLI}: 
	stable command-line interface to Mesmer tools
	(\textit{Rust})

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Created a tool to expose most Mesmer platform functionality to developers working from the command line.
	\item Handled frequent changes in unstable internal APIs to maintain a stable ``evergreen'' public scripting interface
	\item Implemented CI/CD and a comprehensive test suite, auto-importing user error reports into failing tests, and deploying fixes across Mac, Windows, and Linux auto-updaters in 20min
	\item Provided front-line support, dealing directly with five Fortune 500 clients and many other smaller businesses
	\end{itemize}

\work
{2019}
{Wolfram Research}
{Waltham, Massachusetts}
{Student, Wolfram Summer Camp}
{
	Researched both traditional and machine learning approaches to algorithmically determine the physical scale of satellite images. Final model achieved $r^2 = 0.73$ using feature extraction and a small dense neural net.
}


\work
{2017-2018}
{Transparensee Systems}
{New York, NY}
{Intern, Developer}
{
	Created a client-facing customization tool for web embeds. This project was deployed to more than 60 local newspapers across the US, allowing non-technical users to integrate real estate platform \www{enclosure.io} and agricultural classifieds site \www{agrisearch.com} with their own properties. (\textit{React/Redux, Express.js})
}
